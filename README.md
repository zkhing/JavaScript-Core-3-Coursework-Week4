# JavaScript-Core-3-Coursework-Week4-London8

## Setup

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`

The exercises are split into three folders: `A-pass-tests`, `B-write-tests` and `C-TDD`

## Usage

To run the tests from the terminal, run the command `npm test`.

To keep the tests running (auto updating when you save files), run the command: `npm test -- --watch` then press `a` to run all the tests and keep watching the files for changes. To quit the tests, type `q`.

To run a specifc test, run `npm test <filname>` for example `npm test remove-vowels` (that will run only the files that matches remove-vowels, i.e. remove-vowels.test.js)

### Pass Tests

The first set of exercises involve a set of tests that we will write code to make it pass. You can run only the tests in the _A-pass-tests_ folder by running `npm test A-pass-tests` or you can run them with a watch with `npm test A-pass-tests --watch`.

### Write Tests

The second set of exercises involve implemented code that we will add tests for. You can run only the tests in the _B-write-tests_ folder by running `npm test B-write-tests` or you can run them with a watch with `npm test B-write-tests --watch`.

Think about **edge cases** while writing tests.

### TDD

The final exercises involve using TDD to implement functions. You can run only the tests in the _C-TDD_ folder by running `npm test C-TDD` or you can run them with a watch with `npm test C-TDD --watch`.

## Instructions for submission

1. Complete the challenges and tests in each file and save it once you're happy with your changes
2. Run the script to check the results against the tests - all of the exercises should have tests which PASS. If a test reads FAILED, find the associated test/code and fix it.
3. Raise a PR once you're happy with the quality of your code
